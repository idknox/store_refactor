# In this semi-fictionalised version of the BiggerPockets Store, we are selling
# one of our real estate investing education books and tickets to our
# conference. We are constantly trying to expand to offer our products
# to new markets around the world, so we continually need to add support
# for different payment gateways and methods. Also, as the company grows,
# we plan to bring new sales and marketing staff on board who will need to
# see order data in various formats (HTML, XML, etc.). Additionally, we are
# planning to introduce a lot of new products into the store very soon, such as
# software and training seminars.
